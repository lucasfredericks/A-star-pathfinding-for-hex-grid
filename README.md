# A-star-pathfinding-for-hex-grid
Implementation of Daniel Shiffman's A* pathfinding tutorial (https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/051.1-astar.html) modified for a cube hexagonal grid based on the Red Blob Games hex grid tutorial (https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#pathfinding)

This will be used in a derivation of the Atacama Rover exhibit project to pass/fail randomly generated maps
